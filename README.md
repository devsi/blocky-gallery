# Blocky Gallery

Blocky Gallery is a jQuery image gallery that will fill any given space evenly. It use a Linear Partition algorithm to 
calculate the most efficient use of space, resulting in a well distributed grid of images. A particularly good choice
for responsive websites.

Content still to come
